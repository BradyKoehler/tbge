Tile Based Game Engine
======================


Introduction
------------

Tile Based Game Engine  is a project  by UCAS students,  headed by Adam Hovorka,
to create an RPG-like tile-based game engine in JavaScript/jQuery.

The project includes a demo file,  `game.html`,  that shows off some of the main
features of the engine.
